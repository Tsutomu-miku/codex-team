# codex-team AGENTS

This file contains repository-stable engineering constraints for agents.
Detailed design notes live in `docs/internal/`.

## Guardrails

- Do not add a command by querying both Desktop and direct runtime paths unless the command semantics explicitly require it.
- Do not spread new platform-specific Desktop process logic outside the Desktop launcher boundary.
- Do not duplicate plan or quota normalization rules outside `src/plan-quota-profile.ts`.

## Module Boundaries

- `src/main.ts`: CLI orchestration only.
- `src/commands/*`: command handlers.
- `src/codex-desktop-launch.ts`: managed Desktop lifecycle, DevTools bridge, Desktop runtime reads, and watch stream handling.
- `src/codex-direct-client.ts`: direct `codex app-server` client for one-shot runtime reads.
- `src/watch-history.ts`: watch history persistence and ETA calculation.
- `src/plan-quota-profile.ts`: centralized plan normalization and quota ratio rules.
- `src/cli/quota.ts`: quota presentation, list ordering, and auto-switch candidate formatting.

## Runtime Path Rules

- `current`: Desktop-first, direct fallback.
- `watch`: Desktop-only.
- `switch`: Desktop-only.
- `doctor`: direct-first; Desktop only for supplemental consistency checks.

## Quota And Ranking Rules

- Keep plan normalization centralized in `src/plan-quota-profile.ts`.
- Treat ETA as display and analysis data unless a command explicitly uses it for decisions.
- Keep `list` ordering and `auto-switch` ranking as separate concerns when their user goals differ.

## Verification

- For user-visible CLI behavior changes, run `pnpm typecheck` and `pnpm test`.
